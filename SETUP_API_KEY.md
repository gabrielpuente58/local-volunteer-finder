# Google Places API Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

1. ‚úÖ Installed `react-native-google-places-autocomplete`
2. ‚úÖ Created `.env` file for API key
3. ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to protect your API key
4. ‚úÖ Configured babel to support environment variables
5. ‚úÖ Updated OpportunityForm with Google Places Autocomplete
6. ‚úÖ Added coordinates field to Opportunity type
7. ‚úÖ Updated Map to display opportunity markers with callouts

## üîë Add Your API Key

**IMPORTANT:** Replace the placeholder with your actual Google Places API key:

### Option 1: In `.env` file (Recommended)

1. Open `.env` file in the root directory
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

### Option 2: Directly in code (Quick test)

1. Open `components/OpportunityForm.tsx`
2. Find line 22: `const GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";`
3. Replace with your API key:
   ```typescript
   const GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY = "AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX";
   ```

## üöÄ How to Use

### For Admin Users:

1. **Create an Opportunity:**

   - Go to Opportunities tab
   - Tap the + button
   - Fill in opportunity details

2. **Add Location:**

   - In the "Location" field, start typing an address
   - Google will suggest addresses as you type
   - Select the correct address from the suggestions
   - The app automatically saves the coordinates!

3. **Complete & Submit:**
   - Fill in remaining fields (date, time, etc.)
   - Tap "Create Opportunity"

### For Regular Users:

1. **View on Map:**
   - Go to the Map tab
   - See markers for all opportunities with locations
   - Tap a marker to see opportunity details
   - Details include name, description, location, date, and volunteers needed

## üéØ What Happens Behind the Scenes

1. User types address ‚Üí Google Places Autocomplete suggests addresses
2. User selects address ‚Üí App calls Google Geocoding API
3. Geocoding returns latitude & longitude coordinates
4. App saves both the address string AND coordinates
5. Map displays marker at those coordinates
6. Tap marker ‚Üí Callout shows opportunity info

## üîí Security Note

Your `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` so your API key won't be committed to git!

## üß™ Testing

After adding your API key:

1. Restart your development server: `npx expo start`
2. Create a new opportunity as an admin
3. Try typing an address - you should see autocomplete suggestions
4. Select an address and submit
5. Go to the Map tab - you should see a marker at that location
6. Tap the marker to see the callout with details

## üìù API Key Restrictions (Recommended)

In Google Cloud Console, restrict your API key:

- **Application restrictions:** iOS/Android with your bundle ID
- **API restrictions:** Only allow:
  - Places API
  - Geocoding API

This prevents unauthorized use of your API key!
